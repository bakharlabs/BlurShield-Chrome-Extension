# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 px icon for the browser toolbar
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 px icon for the extension management page
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 px icon for the extensions page
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 px icon for the Chrome Web Store

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Ensure good contrast and visibility at small sizes
- Consider the blur/privacy theme (e.g., eye with slash, blur effect symbol)
- Follow Google's Material Design principles
- Use PNG format with transparency

## Temporary Setup

For development, you can create simple colored square icons or use online icon generators.
The extension will still work without icons, but they improve the user experience.
